Here is a page about me.

I have a few years of experience of automation testing. Mostly I write on Java and use 
following libraries: Junit, Rest-assured, Selenide, Selenium. I have built automation 
testing for web-services. Usually it was restful api. But I have mature experience with 
UI automation as well. Moreover I have developed my own applications based on 
web-services, using Spring, Hibernate, Liquibase. 

I'm also a part of open-source community, I contribute to some libraries. 
You can check my github [profile](https://github.com/nick318). 
I use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9142561/nick318) to solve problems
 when I have lack of knowledge.  
 
Recently I started to go deeper to developer's side. Because I believe developer should
write automation tests. Not someone else from outside.
